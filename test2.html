<p>This is another test file. It can be used to document the feature that allows for multiple documents to be opened from the same instance of WebWhirr.</p>
<p>To use this, when asked to select an HTML file, select one of the test files included with WebWhirr--that is, <b>test.html</b>, <b>test2.html</b>, or <b>test3.html</b>.</p>

<!--As this is a comment, it will not be read.-->

<p>Eventually, WebWhirr will gain more features, such as the ability to connect to the internet and a fully featured, customizable interface. For now, however, the focus is on building the rendering base that will be used in the browser.</p>
